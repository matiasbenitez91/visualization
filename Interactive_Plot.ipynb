    "When defining a performance metric for how good a given car is, the obvious question is: good for who? What is \"good\"? The answer, of course, depends on the customer's preferences. A sports car enthusiast would likely care more about horsepower and acceleration than miles per gallon (MPG). On the other hand, a family looking for economical cars would likely care more about MPG than horsepower. It is not possible to create a single value that measures car performance and generalizes well to all kinds of customers.\n",

    "Since the preferences of a given customer are not known, a better solution would be to use visualizations that allow the customer to compare one particular car with the others. So, I developed this simple tool that displays the features of a car and lets the customer compare it against other cars."

    "2. **Left plot**: This bar chart plots a percentage comparison of the chosen car's features with the average car's features. For example, the *amc ambassador brougham* has 42% lower MPG and 65% higher horsepower than the average car. Moreover, I added some options that allow the customers to customize their comparisons by selecting against which type of cars they would like to compare. For example, a customer interested in sports cars might be interested in comparing the chosen car with high-horsepower cars, not average cars. If the customer selects *All*, no filters are applied and the comparison is made against the overall average.\n",

This is another way for the customer to examine a relative comparison based on the features they value most."
